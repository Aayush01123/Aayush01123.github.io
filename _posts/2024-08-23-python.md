# Modules and pip in Python
<br>

Modules like a code library which can be used to borrow the code written by somebody else in our python program. There are two of modules in python.

1. Built in Modules- These modules are ready to import and use with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicilty

2. External ModulesThese modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different version of a same modules with time.</ul>

# The pip command
It can be used as a package manager pip to install a python module. Lets install a module called pandas using the following command.

- pip install pandas

# Using a module in Python(Usage)
We use the import syntax to import a module in Python. Here is an example code.

``` import pandas
# Read and work with a file named 'word.csv'
pandas.read_csv('words.csv')
 ```

Similarly we can install modules and look into their documentations for usage instruction will find ourselved doing this often in the later part of this course
